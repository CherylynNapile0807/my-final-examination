The concept of Git. Developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. 
These commands are often executed directly from the instruction or by using an application like GitHub Desktop or Git Kraken. 
The repository holds all versions of the content, while the working directory is the place where you modify the code. 
You checkout code from the repository to the working directory and commit changes youâ€™ve made during this working directory into a replacement version of the content within the repository. 
While GitHub is one of the foremost widely used platforms by developers for hosting repositories stored within the cloud. 
Continuous Integration (IC) is a practice that needs frequently adding new shared code to a repository to detect errors within the shortest possible time. For this reason, GitHub proposed not only to host our code in their repositories, 
but to automate the compilation and testing steps of our projects.
